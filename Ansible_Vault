Ansible vault is a feature of ansible that allows you to keep sensitive data such as passwords or keys in encrypted files, rather than as plaintext in playbooks or roles.

 

Create: to create ansible vault file in the encrypted format
  # ansible-vault create vault-demo.yml

cat vault-demo.yml

view: to view data of encrypted file
  # ansible-vault view vault-demo.yml

edit: to edit encrypted file
  # ansible-vault edit vault-demo.yml

decrypt: to decrypt an encrypted file
  # ansible-vault decrypt vault-demo.yml

--ask-vault-pass: to provide password while running playbook
  # ansible-playbook ansible-vault.yml --ask-vault-demo

-vault-password-file: to pass a vault password through a file
  # ansible-playbook ansible-vault.yml --vault-password-file vault.yml
